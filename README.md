# commons-cops
**Platform for the communities of the CommonS Erasmus+ Project**

[*CommonS*](www.commonspaces.eu) is an [*Erasmus+*](ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/index_en.htm) project funded by the EU,
aimed at experimenting new forms of co-learning, e-tutoring and e-mentoring.

The *Commons Platform* will support Communities of Practice (CoPs) in their activities.
CoPs will comprise teachers, students, young and senior professionals;
they will work mainly to the retrieval, adaptation (including translation),
reuse and remix of available OER contents, also in order to propose some learning paths.

We will start by creating a [Django](www.djangoproject.com) *starter project* that will customize and wrap the [*Mayan-EDMS*](github.com/mayan-edms) application
in order to be able to create a *Sample OER Library* (OER = open educational resources).

My organization and other partners of the CommonS Project have much experience in developing applications
and tools with OS software, but this is our first attempt at using Git and GitHub.

Within a few months, we intend to publish documentation useful to get collaboration from others,
but at this moment we are still developing design ideas and organizing development work.

The *production* version of the Platform will run on Linux-Ubuntu, but we want to be able
to deploy it and to perform some development also on Windows:
thus, we are producing patches and instructions for installing Mayan-EDMS on Windows.
