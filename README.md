**Platform for the communities of the CommonS Erasmus+ Project**

[*CommonS*](http://www.commonspaces.eu) (= Common Spaces) is an [*Erasmus+*](http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/index_en.htm) project funded by the EU,
aimed at experimenting new forms of co-learning, e-tutoring and e-mentoring.

The *Commons Platform* will support Communities of Practice (CoPs) in their activities.
CoPs will comprise teachers, students, young and senior professionals;
they will work mainly to the retrieval, adaptation (including translation),
reuse and remix of available educational contents, to be used as building blocks of learning paths.

We will start by creating a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) *starter project* that will customize and wrap the [*Mayan-EDMS*](https://github.com/mayan-edms) application
in order to be able to create a *Sample OER Library* (OER = open educational resources).

My organization and other partners of the CommonS Project have much experience in developing applications
and tools with OS software, but this is our first attempt at using Git and GitHub.

Within a few months, we intend to publish documentation useful to get collaboration from others,
but at this moment we are still finalizing the requirements and designing the preliminary software architecture.

The *production* version of the Platform runs on Linux-Ubuntu, but we are performing most of development on Windows: using *commons* as a Django *starter project*, we were able to deploy Mayan-EDMS also on Windows.
